 * Thread cache (L1) — per-thread allocator state. Foundation cycle:
 * this header / TU lands the `__thread` cache pointer, the lazy
 * first-touch initializer, and the `pthread_key_create` destructor
 * that reclaims the cache when a thread exits (architecture.md §2.1
 * + thread-cache.md §2.1). The fast-path routing (TLS load → bin
 * pop, page mask → magic check → bin push, bin overflow → batch
 * flush) lands in subsequent cycles; today the cache is allocated
 * and torn down correctly but is otherwise inert — v8m_dispatch
 * still serves every alloc/free directly from the slab / buddy /
 * Large backends.
 *
 * Concurrency model: each thread sees a private `t_cache` pointer.
 * No locks are taken on the get-or-create path; the lazy
 * initializer reads the TLS slot, allocates if NULL, registers the
 * pointer with the pthread_key so the runtime calls our destructor
 * on thread exit, and stores the pointer back in TLS. The remote
 * MPSC queue (already implemented in v8m_remote_free.h) is the
 * exception — peer threads push freed objects into our remote
 * queue, the owner thread drains it on its next slow path.
