# Changelog

All notable changes to v8malloc are documented here.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and the project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Library project layout (`include/`, `src/`, `tests/`, `bench/`,
  `cmake/`, `man/`).
- CMake build producing both shared and static libraries with semver
  alignment and a single `V8MALLOC_1.0` linker version script.
- `pkg-config` (`v8malloc.pc`) and CMake (`v8mallocConfig.cmake`)
  package descriptors.
- Public version API: `v8m_version`, `v8m_version_major`,
  `v8m_version_minor`, `v8m_version_patch`, plus matching compile-time
  macros.
- Size-class machinery: branchless `v8m_size_class()` mapping an
  allocation request to one of 41 size classes (Tiny / Small / Medium
  / Large) or the `V8M_CLASS_HUGE` sentinel, plus the pinned
  `v8m_class_to_size[]` reverse-lookup table. Round-trip-verified
  exhaustively over every size in [0, 2 MiB].
- OSS scaffolding: `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`,
  `SECURITY.md`, GitHub issue and pull-request templates,
  `man/v8malloc.3`.
